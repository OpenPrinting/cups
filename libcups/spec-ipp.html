    </ul>
    <p>CUPS also defines 17 new operations and many new attributes to support multiple IPP printers and printer classes on a single host.</p>

    <h3 id='IPP_URIS'>IPP URIs</h3>
    <p>CUPS supports the "ipp" and "ipps" schemes. The following resource names are used:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/</tt></dt>
      <dd>Can be used for all "get" operations and for server subscriptions (deprecated).</dd>

      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/admin</tt></dt>
      <dd>Used for all administrative operations (deprecated).</dd>

      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/classes/PRINTER-NAME</tt></dt>
      <dd>Specifies a printer class (deprecated).</dd>

      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/ipp/print/PRINTER-NAME</tt></dt>
      <dd>Specifies a printer.</dd>

      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/ipp/print/PRINTER-NAME/JOB-ID</tt></dt>
      <dd>Specifies a job.</dd>

      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/ipp/system</tt></dt>
      <dd>Used for all system-wide operations.</dd>

      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/jobs/JOB-ID</tt></dt>
      <dd>Specifies a job (deprecated).</dd>

      <dt><tt>SCHEME://HOSTNAME:PORT/printers/PRINTER-NAME</tt></dt>
      <dd>Specifies a printer (deprecated).</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>So a typical printer URI would be "ipp://foo.example.com/ipp/print/LaserJet".</p>


    <h3 id='IPP_OPERATIONS'>CUPS IPP Operations</h3>
    <p>CUPS defines 17 vendor operations in addition to extending some of the standard IPP and registered extension operations:</p>

    <h2 id='OPERATIONS'>Operations</h2>
    <p>The following sections describe the operations supported by CUPS. In the interest of brevity, operations which use only the standard IPP attributes are not described.


    <h3 id='CANCEL_JOB'>Cancel-Job Operation (extension)</h3>
    <p>The Cancel-Job operation (0x0008) cancels the specified job. CUPS 1.4 added support for the <tt>purge-job (boolean)</tt> operation attribute that (if 'true') removes all history and document files for the job as well. This attribute is no longer supported since CUPS 3.0.</p>


    <h3 id='CREATE_PRINTER_SUBSCRIPTION'>Create-Printer-Subscription (deprecated extension)</h3>
    <p>The Create-Printer-Subscription operation (0x0016) creates a subscription for printer event notifications. CUPS 1.2 provided several additional extension events:<p>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>printer-added</tt> - Get notified whenever a printer or class is added</li>
      <li><tt>printer-deleted</tt> - Get notified whenever a printer or class is deleted</li>
      <li><tt>printer-modified</tt> - Get notified whenever a printer or class is modified</li>
      <li><tt>server-audit</tt> - Get notified when a security condition occurs</li>
      <li><tt>server-restarted</tt> - Get notified when the server is restarted</li>
      <li><tt>server-started</tt> - Get notified when the server is started</li>
      <li><tt>server-stopped</tt> - Get notified when the server is stopped</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These keywords are no longer supported since CUPS 3.0.</p>


    <h3 id='CUPS_GET_DEFAULT'><span class='info'>Deprecated</span>CUPS-Get-Default Operation</h3>

    <h2 id='ATTRIBUTES'>Attributes</h2>
    <p>CUPS provides many extension attributes to support multiple devices, PPD files, standard job filters, printers, and printer classes.</p>


    <h3 id='DEVICE_ATTRIBUTES'><span class="info">Deprecated</span>Device Attributes</h3>
    <p>Device attributes are returned by the CUPS-Get-Devices operation and enumerate all of the available hardware devices and network protocols that are supported by the server. Device attributes are reported in the printer-attributes-tag group.</p>

    <h4 id='device-class'><span class="info">Deprecated</span>device-class (type2 keyword)</h4>
    <p>The "device-class" attribute provides the class of device and can be one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>'file': A disk file.
      <li>'direct': A parallel or fixed-rate serial data port, currently used for Centronics, IEEE-1284, and USB printer ports.
      <li>'serial': A variable-rate serial port.
      <li>'network': A network connection, typically via AppSocket, HTTP, IPP, LPD, or SMB/CIFS protocols.
    </ul>

    <h4 id='device-id'><span class="info">Deprecated</span>device-id (text(1023))</h4>
    <p>The "device-id" attribute provides the IEEE-1284 device ID string for the device.</p>

    <h4 id='device-info'><span class="info">Deprecated</span>device-info (text(127))</h4>
    <p>The "device-info" attribute specifies a human-readable string describing the device, e.g., 'Parallel Port #1'.

    <h4 id='device-location'><span class="info">Deprecated</span>device-location (text(127))</h4>
    <p>The "device-location" attribute specifies the physical location of the printer, e.g., '2nd Floor Computer Lab'.

    <h4 id='device-make-and-model'><span class="info">Deprecated</span>device-make-and-model (text(127))</h4>
    <p>The "device-make-and-model" attribute specifies a device identification string provided by the printer connected to the device. If the device or printer does not support identification then this attribute contains the string 'unknown'.

    <h4 id='device-uri'><span class="info">Deprecated</span>device-uri (uri)</h4>
    <p>The "device-uri" attribute specifies a unique identifier for the device. The actual format of the "device-uri" string depends on the value of the "device-class" attribute:
    <ul>
      <li>'file': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'file:///path/to/filename'.
      <li>'direct': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'scheme:/dev/filename' or 'scheme://vendor/identifier', where scheme may be 'parallel' or 'usb' in the current implementation.
      <li>'serial': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'serial:/dev/filename?baud=value+parity=value+flow=value'. The baud value is the data rate in bits per second; the supported values depend on the underlying hardware. The parity value can be one of "none", "even", or "odd". The flow value can be one of "none", "soft" (XON/XOFF handshaking), "hard" or "rts/cts" (RTS/CTS handshaking), or "dtrdsr" (DTR/DSR handshaking).
      <p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will contain the maximum baud rate supported by the device and the best type of flow control available ("soft" or "hard").
      <li>'network': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'scheme://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/[resource]', where scheme may be "http", "https", "ipp", "lpd", "smb", or "socket" in the current implementation.
      <p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices MAY only contain the scheme name ('scheme'). It is up to the client application to add the appropriate host and other information when adding a new printer.
      <p>The URI returned by Get-Printer-Attributes and CUPS-Get-Printers has any username and password information stripped; the information is still stored and used by the server internally to perform any needed authentication.
    </ul>

    <p>The "job-sheets" attribute specifies one or two banner files that are printed before and after a job. The reserved value of "none" disables banner printing. The default value is stored in the "job-sheets-default" attribute.
    <p>If only one value is supplied, the banner file is printed before the job. If two values are supplied, the first value is used as the starting banner file and the second as the ending banner file.

    <h4 id='job-originating-host-name'>job-originating-host-name (name(MAX))</h4>
    <p>The "job-originating-host-name" status attribute specifies the host from which the job was queued. The value will be the hostname or IP address of the client depending on whether hostname resolution is enabled.  The localhost address (127.0.0.1) is <b>always</b> resolved to the name "localhost".
    <p>This attribute is read-only.

    <h4 id='page-border'>page-border (type2 keyword)</h4>
