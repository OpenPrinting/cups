Contributing to CUPS
====================
CUPS is developed by OpenPrinting and distributed as open source software under the Apache License, Version 2.0 with exceptions to allow linking to GPL2/LGPL2 code.

Thank you for wanting to help us improve CUPS! There are a variety of ways you can contribute to this project, including no-code and low-code options. This documentation will help orient you with our processes.

Please make sure that you read this guide before starting to contribute. It contains all the details you need to know to give your contribution the best chance of being accepted.

Contributions should be submitted either as pull requests or as attachments (unified diffs) to bug reports on the OpenPrinting CUPS GitHub project at [https://github.com/openprinting/cups](https://github.com/openprinting/cups).

## Documentation contributions

CUPS is hosted and managed on GitHub. If you're not familiar with how GitHub works, their [quickstart documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey) provides an excellent introduction to all the tools and processes you will need to know.

To contribute to the CUPS documentation, you will need to fork the project. Once you have done so, you will need to open a pull request to add or edit the material in the doc folder.

### Documentation contribution reviews

We are a small team of volunteers so reviews can take a bit of time. Please be patient, we will do our best to get to your contribution as quickly as possible.

If we need to reject your contribution, you will receive comments about why and what needs to be changed. If it is accepted, your PR will be merged and reallocated where necessary by the maintaining team.

We will review contributions based on two main aspects: style and technical accuracy. For style reviews, please follow this [style guide](https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/guidelines/devel-docs.html).

For technical reviews, the person who wrote the code you are documenting will review your contribution to make sure it is accurate.
