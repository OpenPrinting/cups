<p>mime.convs - mime type conversion file for cups (deprecated)
</p>
    <h2 id="mime.convs-5.description">Description</h2>
<p>The <strong>mime.convs</strong> file defines the filters that are available for converting files from one format to another.
The standard filters support text, PDF, PostScript, and many types of image files.
</p>
    <p>Additional filters are specified in files with the extension <em>.convs</em> in the CUPS configuration directory.
</p>
    <p>Each line in the <strong>mime.convs</strong> file is a comment, blank, or filter
line.
Comment lines start with the # character.
Filter lines specify the source and destination MIME types along with a relative cost associated with the filter and the filter to run:
</p>
    <pre>
    source/type destination/type cost filter

</pre>
<p>The <em>source/type</em> field specifies the source MIME media type that is consumed by the filter.
</p>
    <p>The <em>destination/type</em> field specifies the destination MIME media type that is produced by the filter.
</p>
    <p>The <em>cost</em> field specifies the relative cost for running the filter.
A value of 100 means that the filter uses a large amount of resources while a value of 0 means that the filter uses very few resources.
</p>
    <p>The <em>filter</em> field specifies the filter program filename.
Filenames are relative to the CUPS filter directory.
</p>

<em>/usr/lib/cups/filter</em> - Typical CUPS filter directory.
