<H1 CLASS="title">CUPS Implementation of IPP</H1>

<h2 class='title'><a name='INTRODUCTION'>Introduction</a></h2>

<p>CUPS implements <a href="http://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/standards/std-ipp20-20151030-5100.12.pdf">IPP/2.1</a> and the operations and attributes defined in the following specifications:</p>

<ul>

	<li><a href="http://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobprinterext10-20101030-5100.11.pdf">PWG 5100.11: IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 2 (JPS2)</a> (all operations plus the "job-creation-attributes-supported", "job-ids", "job-password", "job-password-encryption", "media-col-database", and "which-jobs" attributes)</li>

	<li><a href="http://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippjobprinterext3v10-20120727-5100.13.pdf">PWG 5100.13: IPP Job and Printer Extensions - Set 3 (JPS3)</a> (all operations/attributes required for IPP Everywhere except "printer-geo-location" and "printer-icc-profiles")</li>

	<li><a href="http://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippeve10-20130128-5100.14.pdf">PWG 5100.14: IPP Everywhere</a> (conforming to the Client and most of the Printer requirements)</li>

	<li><a href="http://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ippfaxout10-20140618-5100.15.pdf">PWG 5100.15: IPP FaxOut Service</a> (for facsimile queues)</li>

	<li><a href="http://ftp.pwg.org/pub/pwg/candidates/cs-ipptrans10-20131108-5100.16.pdf">PWG 5100.16: IPP Transaction-Based Printing Extensions</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3995">RFC 3995: IPP: Event Notifications and Subscriptions</a></li>

	<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3996">RFC 3996: IPP: The 'ippget' Delivery Method for Event Notifications</li>

	<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3998">RFC 3998: IPP: Job and Printer Administrative Operations</a> (Disable-Printer, Enable-Printer, Hold-New-Jobs, and Release-Held-New-Jobs operations)</li>

	<li><a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7472">RFC 7472: IPP over HTTPS Transport Binding and 'ipps' URI Scheme</a></li>

</ul>

<p>CUPS also provides 17 new operations and many new attributes to support multiple IPP printers and printer classes on a single host.</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='IPP_URIS'>IPP URIs</a></h3>

<p>CUPS supports the "http", "https", "ipp", and "ipps" schemes. The following resource names are used:</p>

<dl>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/</tt></dt>

	<dd>Can be used for all "get" operations and for server subscriptions.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/admin/</tt></dt>

	<dd>Used for all administrative operations.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/classes/name</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a printer class.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/jobs/id</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a job.</dd>

	<dt><tt>scheme://hostname:port/printers/name</tt></dt>

	<dd>Specifies a printer.</dd>

</dl>

<p>So a typical printer URI would be "ipp://foo.example.com/printers/LaserJet". In addition, the CUPS scheduler also supports (when enabled) normal browser access via "http://foo.example.com:port/" and "https://foo.example.com:port/".</p>

<h3 class='title'><a name='IPP_OPERATIONS'>CUPS IPP Operations</a></h3>

<p>CUPS provides 17 vendor extension operations in addition to most of the standard IPP and registered extension operations:</p>

<h2 class='title'><a name='OPERATIONS'>Operations</a></h2>

<p>The following sections describe the operations supported by CUPS. In the interest of brevity, operations which use only the standard IPP attributes are not described.


<h3 class='title'><a name='CANCEL_JOB'>Cancel Job Operation (Extension)</a></h3>

<p>The Cancel-Job operation (0x0008) cancels the specified job. CUPS 1.4 added support for the <tt>purge-job (boolean)</tt> operation attribute that (if 'true') removes all history and document files for the job as well.</p>


<h3 class='title'><a name='PURGE_JOBS'>Purge-Jobs Operation</a></h3>

<p>The Purge-Jobs operation (0x0012) cancels all of the jobs on a given destination and optionally removes all history and document files for the jobs as well. CUPS 1.2 added support for the <tt>purge-job (boolean)</tt> operation attribute that (if 'false') retains all history and document files for the canceled jobs.</p>

<blockquote><b>Note:</b>
	<p>The Cancel-Jobs and Cancel-My-Jobs operations should be used instead of Purge-Jobs.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3 class='title'><span class='info'>CUPS 1.2/macOS 10.5</span><a
name='CREATE_PRINTER_SUBSCRIPTION'>Create-Printer-Subscription</a></h3>

<p>The Create-Printer-Subscription operation (0x0016) creates a subscription for printer or server event notifications. CUPS provides several additional events in addition to the standard events in the IPP notifications specification. CUPS adds the following <tt>notify-events (1setOf type2 keyword)</tt> values:<p>

<ul>

	<li><tt>printer-added</tt> - Get notified whenever a printer or class is added</li>

	<li><tt>printer-deleted</tt> - Get notified whenever a printer or class is deleted</li>

	<li><tt>printer-modified</tt> - Get notified whenever a printer or class is modified</li>

	<li><tt>server-audit</tt> - Get notified when a security condition occurs</li>

	<li><tt>server-restarted</tt> - Get notified when the server is restarted</li>

	<li><tt>server-started</tt> - Get notified when the server is started</li>

	<li><tt>server-stopped</tt> - Get notified when the server is stopped</li>

</ul>

<h4><a name="device-class">device-class (type2 keyword)</a><span class="info">Deprecated</span></h4>

<p>The "device-class" attribute provides the class of device and can be one of the following:

<ul>

	<li>'file': A disk file.

	<li>'direct': A parallel or fixed-rate serial data port,
	currently used for Centronics, IEEE-1284, and USB printer
	ports.

<h4><a name="device-uri">device-uri (uri)</a></h4>

<p>The "device-uri" attribute specifies a unique identifier for the device. The actual format of the "device-uri" string depends on the value of the "device-class" attribute:

<ul>

	<li>'file': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'file:///path/to/filename'.

	<li>'direct': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'scheme:/dev/filename' or 'scheme://vendor/identifier', where scheme may be 'parallel' or 'usb' in the current implementation.

	<li>'serial': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'serial:/dev/filename?baud=value+parity=value+flow=value'. The baud value is the data rate in bits per second; the supported values depend on the underlying hardware. The parity value can be one of "none", "even", or "odd". The flow value can be one of "none", "soft" (XON/XOFF handshaking), "hard" or "rts/cts" (RTS/CTS handshaking), or "dtrdsr" (DTR/DSR handshaking).

	<p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices will contain the maximum baud rate supported by the device and the best type of flow control available ("soft" or "hard").

	<li>'network': The "device-uri" will be of the form 'scheme://[username:password@]hostname[:port]/[resource]', where scheme may be "http", "https", "ipp", "lpd", "smb", or "socket" in the current implementation.

	<p>The URI returned by CUPS-Get-Devices MAY only contain the scheme name ('scheme'). It is up to the client application to add the appropriate host and other information when adding a new printer.

	<p>The URI returned by Get-Printer-Attributes and CUPS-Get-Printers has any username and password information stripped; the information is still stored and used by the server internally to perform any needed authentication.
